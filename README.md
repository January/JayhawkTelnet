JayhawkTelnet
==============
A telnet-based microservice dedicated to serving up statistics and information about KU sports.

What sports are supported?
---------------------------
Only KU football right now.

KU basketball (men's and women's), KU baseball, and KU soccer will be implemented when it's doneâ„¢.

Is there a demo server?
-----------------------
When it's more complete, there will be.

Why did you make this?
-----------------------
I heard stories of a Telnet server officially hosted by KU in the olden days that could be used to quickly check sports info. Of course, said server doesn't exist anymore, but it gave me the idea to recreate it for fun. Why not?

Can I fork it and make a Telnet server for my own team?
-------------------------------------------------------
Well, maybe later. It's unfinished in its current state. But I plan on doing all the legwork of dealing with ESPN's weirdly convoluted API for you, and making it easy to modify for any college team.
