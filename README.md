JayhawkTelnet
==============
A telnet-based microservice dedicated to serving up statistics and information about KU sports.

What sports are supported?
---------------------------
KU football, KU basketball, KU baseball, and KU soccer.

Is there a demo server?
-----------------------
Yes, you can connect to it at [IP will be here] using any telnet client.

Why did you make this?
-----------------------
I heard stories of a Telnet server officially hosted by KU that could be used to quickly check sports info. Of course, said server doesn't exist anymore, but it gave me the idea to recreate it. Why not?

Can I fork it and make a Telnet server for my own team?
-------------------------------------------------------
Absolutely! I've even done all the legwork of dealing with ESPN's convoluted API for you, and made it pretty easy to modify the project for any college team. Try it out!
